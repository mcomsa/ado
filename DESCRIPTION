Title: An Implementation of Stata's Ado Language for R
Description: An interpreter for Stata's ado language built on top of R.
    Loops, macros, data manipulation commands and statistics commands are all
    supported, as are multiple ways to embed R code and use R for writing ado-
    language commands. (The language this package implements has about the same
    relationship to Stata that various dialects of SQL have to each other.)
